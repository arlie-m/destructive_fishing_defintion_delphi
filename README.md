# Defining Destructive Fishing - expert consultation
Repository for analysis connected with the manuscript for the expert consultation process of the Defining Destructive Fishing CCI collaborative project.

This project used a Delphi process of expert consultation to generate a greater understanding of what experts connected with fisheries think of the term 'destructive fishing'. 

This repository contains the scripts used to analyse the results of 3 rounds of iterative online surveys and generate outputs such as figures. 

To ensure the anonymity of all respondents, some elements of the script are retained for illustrative purposes only because they cannot be run without using data that contains respondents personal information, which will not be made public. 

## File structure

scripts - scripts used to run the analyses and create the figures

workflow - the knitted markdown files containing embedded intermediate figures etc

figures - contains the figures for the manuscript

data - referred to in the scripts to access data files (not included in the code repository)

Individual_figures_Rd_3 - referred to in scripts, the saving location for individual response figures (not included in the code repository because they include personal information)
